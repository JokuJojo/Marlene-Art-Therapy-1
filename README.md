These images now better represent the calming and healing atmosphere of the therapy studio. The content has been expanded with detailed paragraphs written using ChatGPT, providing a comprehensive understanding of the services offered, the benefits of Art Therapy, and how it differs from at-home practices. A Terms and Conditions section has been added, clearly outlining the policies for booking, cancellations, and other important client information, ensuring transparency and trust.

A custom calendar was created using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, enabling clients to easily view availability and book appointments directly through the website. The homepage has been redesigned to be more welcoming, with a clear description of the websiteâ€™s intent and what visitors can expect. Background titles have been updated with high-quality PNG images, ensuring compatibility with Chrome and improving the visual impact. To enhance clarity and maintainability, comments have been added throughout the code, ensuring that future updates and edits can be easily managed.
