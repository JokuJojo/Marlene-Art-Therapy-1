      <p class="studio-texts"> 
      Marlene Art Therapy was established in 2015 by Marlene, who envisioned a space dedicated to healing through creativity.
      After years of personal experience with art as a therapeutic tool, she sought to create a sanctuary where others could explore their emotions in a calm, supportive environment.
      Marlene chose to build the studio in a peaceful, secluded area, away from the hustle of the city, to ensure clients could fully immerse themselves in their creative process. 
      The studio's tranquil setting, combined with its thoughtfully designed space, reflects Marlene's commitment to fostering emotional healing through art.
